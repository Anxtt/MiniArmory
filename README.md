# MiniArmory - Plain and Modest WoW-like Armory

# Project Description and Motivation
MiniArmory is my very first project based on ASP.NET Core. The project was created for graduating from [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg) and learning more about web development and specifically with the aforementioned framework. I look at it as my little playground where I can add new things I learn about. There isn't anything special when it comes to features, but it supports functionality for:

* Register and Login
* Creating various characters
* Character search
* Changing the features of your characters
* 3 activities akin to clicker-simulator:
    * Collecting Achievements
    * Collecting Mounts
    * Playing Arena, teamed up or solo, against other players or not    
* Leaderboards for Arena rating and Achievements
* Admin area for statistics

My inspiration for this project comes from the game World of Warcraft. As a newbie .NET developer and an ardent fan of the universe I reckoned it would be great my first project to be about something I am passionate about.
